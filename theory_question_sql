What is SQL? Why is it important for data analysts?
Answer:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases. It allows data analysts to:
Retrieve specific data using SELECT statements
Join multiple tables to get complete insights
Clean, filter, and summarize large datasets
Create views, update records, and manage database schemas
SQL is crucial because most business data is stored in relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.

2.  What are the different types of JOINs in SQL?
Answer:
There are mainly four types of joins:
ðŸ”¹â€¯INNER JOIN: Returns only matched rows from both tables
ðŸ”¹â€¯LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right
ðŸ”¹â€¯RIGHT JOIN: All rows from the right table and matched rows from the left
ðŸ”¹â€¯FULL JOIN: All rows from both tables, with NULLs where no match exists

3.  What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?
Answer:
WHERE filters rows before aggregation (on raw data).
HAVING filters rows after aggregation (on aggregated results).

4.  What are Window Functions? How are they different from Aggregate Functions?
Answer:
Aggregate functions (like SUM, AVG) group data and return a single value per group.
Window functions return a value for each row while still allowing aggregation over a window (set of rows).

5.  What is data cleaning? Why is it important?
Answer:
Data cleaning is the process of correcting or removing inaccurate, duplicate, or incomplete data.
It is important because:
Inaccurate data can lead to wrong insights
Clean data improves model performance
It ensures better decision-making

6.  What is the difference between primary key and foreign key?
Answer:
ðŸ”¹ Primary Key: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
ðŸ”¹ Foreign Key: A column that links one table to another by referencing the primary key in the related table.

7.  What is normalization in SQL?
Answer:
Normalization is the process of organizing tables to minimize redundancy and dependency. It improves data integrity and efficiency.
Common normal forms:
1NF: No repeating groups
2NF: Full functional dependency
3NF: No transitive dependency
